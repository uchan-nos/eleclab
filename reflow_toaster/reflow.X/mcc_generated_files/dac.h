  @Summary
    Set Input data into DAC.

  @Description
    This routine pass the digital input data into
    DAC voltage reference control register.

  @Preconditions
    The DAC_Initialize() routine should be called
    prior to use this routine.

  @Param
    inputData - 8bit digital data to DAC.

  @Returns
    None

  @Example
    <code>
    uint8_t count=0;

    DAC_Initialize();

    for(count=0; count<=30; count++)
    {
